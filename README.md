# SP-404A tools

the main tool of this project is newSamples.js, which will randomly take up to 120 audio files (of any major audio format) from a specified directory and assign them to your SP-404A SD card, because loading samples from a computer to an SP-404A is really fucking annoying

thx to MatthewCallis for the super-pads repo <3
